Historical country codes
0.1

In this first draft version of HCC(Historical Country Codes),
Eastern Asia (as defined by UN M49) from 1865 to the present
is investigated. 1865 is an arbitrary cutoff inspired by the
formation of ITU(International Telecommunication Union), one
of the oldest intergovernmental organizations in the world.

Principles

1. Codes consist of three alphabet letters followed by four
numeric letters.
2. Three alphabet letters respect ISO 3166 standard.
3. Four numeric letters are intended to remind year numbers
of proleptic Gregorian calendar.

Current country codes

ISO 3166 defines the following 8 codes for countries in Eastern
Asia. Common names are used, hence South Korea, instead of Korea,
Republic of. Same for North Korea and Taiwan.

CHN China
HKG Hong Kong
JPN Japan
KOR South Korea
MAC Macao
MNG Mongolia
PRK North Korea
TWN Taiwan
